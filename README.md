Player Stat Board

This is a player status board I’m creating to gamify my life and make positive habits feel more rewarding.

I’m not trying to become a programmer with this project. I’m building it with the help of AI, with the intention of gradually expanding it over time and adding more game-like elements as I go.

The idea was inspired by Habitica, but I didn’t enjoy the UI. It felt cluttered and had a steep learning curve, so I decided to build something simpler from scratch instead.

This is base code and is meant to be flexible. If you’re interested in collaborating or adding features, feel free to message me — it can easily be modified to fit different users.
